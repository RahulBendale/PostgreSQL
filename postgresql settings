What is WAL?
	WAL is short for Write Ahead Log.
	transaction performed on the database is first written out as a WAL file
	then applied to the actual data files.
	WAL files are strictly sequential	
	"replay log" of changes.

So are they actual files/location?
	Located under data_directory as pg_wal
	/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/pg_wal


How to control wal?
	wal_keep_segments (specifies the minimum number of the past log files segments kept in the pg_xlog direcory)
	max_wal_size      (Maximum size to let the WAL grow as soft limit)

ARCHIVING WALS
**************
	copying out generated WAL files is called archiving.

The ARCHIVE COMMANDS
********************
	The script is set using the archive_command configuration setting

	# Copy the file to a safe loation (like a mounted NFS volume)
	archive_command = 'cp %p /mnt/nfs/%f'

	# Not overwriting files is a good practice
	archive_command = 'test ! -f /mnt/nfs/%f && cp %p /mnt/nfs/%f'

	#Copy to s3 bucket
	archive_command = 's3cmd put %p s3://BUCKET/PATH/%f'

	#Copy to googole cloud bucket
	archive_command = 'gsutil cp %p gs://BUCKET/PATH/%f'

	#An external script
	archive_command = '/opt/scripts/archive_wal %p'
	
The WAL LEVEL:
*************
	minimal wal level.
		information needed to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown
	
	archive (or replica in version 9.6 and above)
	
	replica
		information required to run read-only queries on a standby server.

	logical
		exact logical change sets from WAL.

ARCHIVE TIMEOUT
***************
	no activity then generate a wal after mentioned interval of time.
		archive_timeout = 1h

How to control size and the number of the WAL files
	#This is the soft upper limit on the total size of WAL files.
		max_wal_size = 1GB

	#Keep around at least these many WAL files (aka segments).
		wal_keep_segments = 10

THE ARCHIVAL SETTINGS

	#The WAL level must be archive or higher.
		wal_level = replica
	
	#This is a soft upper limit on the total size of WAL files.
		max_wal_size = 1GB
		

	#Keep around at least these many WAL files (aka segments).
		wal_keep_segments = 10

THE ARCHIVAL SETTINGS

	# The WAL level must be archive or higher.
		wal_level = replica
	
	# This is a soft upper limit on the total size of WAL files.
		max_wal_size = 1GB
			alter system set max_wal_size = '1 GB';

	# Keep around at least these many WAL files (aka segments).
		wal_keep_segments = 10
			alter system set wal_keep_segments = 10;

	# The archive mode must be set to on for archiving to happen.
		archive_mode = on
			alter system set archive_mode = on;
	
	# This is the command to invoke for each WAL file to be archived.
		archive_command = '/postgres/logs/archive_wal %p'
			alter system set archive_command = '/postgres/logs/archive_wal%f'
			alter system set archive_command = 'cp %p /postgres/logs/archive_wal%f';
			'cp %p /Archive/location/%f'


# Ensure there is atleast one wal file for each "archive_timeout" duration.
	archive_timeout = 1h
		alter system set archive_timeout= '1 h';



sudo systemctl restart postgresql-12
