What is WAL?
	WAL is short for Write Ahead Log.
	transaction performed on the database is first written out as a WAL file
	then applied to the actual data files.
	WAL files are strictly sequential	
	"replay log" of changes.

So are they actual files/location?
	Located under data_directory as pg_wal
	/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/pg_wal


How to control wal?
	wal_keep_segments (specifies the minimum number of the past log files segments kept in the pg_xlog direcory)
	max_wal_size      (Maximum size to let the WAL grow as soft limit)

ARCHIVING WALS
	copying out generated WAL files is called archiving.

The ARCHIVE COMMAND
	The script is set using the archive_command configuration setting

	# Copy the file to a safe loation (like a mounted NFS volume)
	archive_command = 'cp %p /mnt/nfs/%f'

	# Not overwriting files is a good practice
	archive_command = 'test ! -f /mnt/nfs/%f && cp %p /mnt/nfs/%f'

	#Copy to s3 bucket
	archive_command = 's3cmd put %p s3://BUCKET/PATH/%f'

	#Copy to googole cloud bucket
	archive_command = 'gsutil cp %p gs://BUCKET/PATH/%f'

	#An external script
